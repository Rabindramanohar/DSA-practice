**steps**
1. Get the length of both strings, and carry variables.
2. while looping till i & j >= 0
3. initialize sum with carry and add char value of the string(by converting char to int)
4. then add modulus of sum in stringbuilder in reverse order
5. and carry = sum/2 : get the quotient value
6. if carry is greater than 0 add 1 to stringbuilder and return
